Archive of completed reverse engineering and pwn challenges

At the current moment im redoing the challeneges from pwnable.xyz as i initially relied on Ghidra's  
decompiler and I'd rather reverse engineer the disassembly (plus its been ages and some aren't even attempted)  
my reasons for doing so are:
1. Ghidra's decompiler is pretty messy and requires cleanup
2. I dont like Ghidras naming scheme for variables
3. Typecasting is a mess
4. I dont trust it to be reliable enough
5. translating the assembly by hand gives me a good grasp of the target architecture
6. I like assembly and translating by hand
7. loops come out weird too
8. pls add dark mode

Don't get me wrong tho, decompilers are still great tools that can give you an idea of the big picture  
of a binary pretty quick and i do like how easy it is to define custom data types and changing function sigs

Also I'm taking a break from **crackmes.one** as i want to feel fully confident in reversing binaries written in assembly  
and C for x86_64 first to form a solid foundation

I'm debating creating writeups for the challenges but for now some will include comments regarding  
vulnerabilities and the process of exploitation in the _pwn_ challenges.

if i find any "_bad practices_" in the reverse challenges i will also leave a comment in the translated  
source file(s)
